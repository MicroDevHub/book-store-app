# Error handling## ProblemIn micro service, if each service throws different error structure, thenthat is a big matter when the front end has to deal with a lot structure of error body to get needed contend![alt text](../assets/issue-error-structure.png)## Solution- We need to have an easy-to-use system for handling any kind of error and sending an identically-structured responseSo that why we need to have a consistently structured for whole servicesFor example:![alt text](../assets/common-error-structure.png)#### We will go to difficulty when handling error:- We must have a consistently structured response from all server, no matter what went wrong.==> Solution: Write an error handling middleware to process error, give them a consistent structure, and send back to the browser- A billion things can to wrong, not just validation of inputs to a request handler. Each of there need to be handledconsistently==> Solution: Make sure we capture all possible error using Express's error handling mechanism (call the 'next' function)![alt text](../assets/error-handler.png)## ImplementThis is structure diagram has been implemented in auth service![alt text](../assets/custorm-error-handler.png)
