# BookStore ApplicationThis is small project about book store has been implemented microservice architecture with Nodejs 16.2 and Angular 11.## Features- Create CRUD book store web app with Angular and Nodejs.- Implement Microservice with Nodejs.- Deployment with Docker, Kubernetes and Skaffold devThis is prototype for app![alt text](documents/assets/prototype-bookstore.png)## TechBlog web app uses a number of open source projects to work properly:- [Angular] - HTML enhanced for web apps!- [NodeJS] - evented I/O for the backend- [Express] - Fast node.js network app framework- [MongoDB] - Database- [Typescript] - Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/vi/) - Open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications- [Skaffold] - Command line tool that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes-native applications***## Introduce SystemArchitecture![alt text](documents/assets/micro-architecture.png)###  1. Client app:TO BE DEFINE### 2. MicroservicesDescribe services:![alt text](documents/assets/services.png)##### service-authThis service will receive request from client to create or get post for user. ![alt text](documents/assets/auth-srv-api.png)##### service-commentsThis service will receive request from client to create or get comments for user. ##### service-queryThis service is about presentation logic, It will join two resource (Posts service and Comments Service).##### service-moderationThis service will moderate user comments to decide whether to approve or not.##### event-busThis service will be the place where all services can communicate with each other### 3. DatabaseType of resource![alt text](documents/assets/type-of-resource.png)***## Installation In Local#### 1. Client##### - BuildRun `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.##### - Running unit testsRun `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).##### - Running end-to-end testsRun `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.***## DevelopmentWant to contribute?
